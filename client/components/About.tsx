              Photography is more than capturing what the eye seesâ€”it's about <span className="highlight">revealing what the heart feels</span>.
              For over a decade, I've been exploring the world through my lens.

              My work spans landscape photography, architectural studies, and candid street scenes.

              Based in the Pacific Northwest, I draw constant inspiration from the interplay between nature and urban life.
